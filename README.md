# Parchis Model
 Runs multiple games of parchis to find out what strategy is better safe or agressive? There is also the option to play it yourself.
 
 
 How To Use
---------------
Install pygame: `python3 -m pip install "pygame"`

Run the code: `python3 test.py [runs]` 

'runs' is an optional parameter to specify the number of runs it should do. Without it you will have to play the game yourself against the computer.
